"""Session counting and debounce helpers.

Detects other Claude Code sessions running in the same cwd so the
statusline can warn that a second interactive instance is active here.

Enumerates `claude` processes whose own cwd matches and which are not in
`-p` headless mode (Task subagents, scripted runs). Ground truth -- catches
idle sessions, ignores ones that cleanly /exit'd a moment ago. Requires
`psutil`; without it the badge stays off entirely (any mtime-based
substitute false-positives for ~5 minutes after a clean /exit, which the
20s restart-handoff debounce can't suppress).
