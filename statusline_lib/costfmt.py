"""Cost/cache segment rendering for line 2.

Split out of cost.py (which keeps the transcript-walking + accumulation) to
stay under the aislop 400-line file gate. cost.py re-exports every public name
here, so `statusline_lib.cost.format_cache` (and the rest) still resolve - this
module is the implementation home, cost.py the back-compat surface.

Imports: base only (color constants, fmt, color_high_good) -- a leaf module, no

    figures - fresh `input` (steel blue) and `output` (violet) - each rendered
    `tokens (cost)` so all four $ components are visible and sum to the token
    cost. They are off by default and gated on their own cost arg, so any caller
    that omits them (subagent render, compact mode) is byte-identical to before.
