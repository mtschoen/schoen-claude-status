"""Install-time wiring for the wrap nudge hook: how the settings.json merge
recognizes, inserts, updates, and dedupes our UserPromptSubmit entry.

Separate from ``nudge.py`` (the runtime state-file contract between the
statusline and the hook): nothing here runs per prompt -- it runs once, when
install.py rewrites Claude Code settings.

Pure dict-in/dict-out helpers -- no file I/O -- so the verify suite can
exercise the merge against in-memory settings.

# than by the script's filename, so the script can be renamed or moved freely

    hook degrades to a log line, never a wedged prompt (and never an error
    injected into Claude's context).

    Claude Code runs hook commands through a shell: PowerShell on Windows (NOT
    cmd.exe -- so %VAR% / ver>nul / || are wrong there; verified empirically by
    the stray-`nul`-file artifact), POSIX sh elsewhere. `$HOME` resolves in both

    pwsh 7 and Windows PowerShell 5.1, neither of which needs `||`)."""
