"""Verify install.py's nudge-hook merge: sentinel-based identity that survives
a script rename, basename migration of pre-sentinel entries, stale-duplicate
removal, empty-group pruning, in-place update, fresh insert, and the
already-current check rejecting settings with leftovers.

Pure in-memory checks against the merge helpers -- no settings.json is read or
