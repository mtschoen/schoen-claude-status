"""Verify `debounce_session_count` — the dwell-based suppressor that keeps the
`[N sessions]` badge quiet during a restart handoff (an old `claude` process
still winding down while a new one spins up).

The statusline only re-renders when a turn is processed, so the dwell is
measured in wall-clock time (compare `now` against a stored "first elevated"
timestamp), never in render counts. State is keyed by cwd in a small JSON file
and is injectable here via `state_path`/`now` so the tests need no real clock
or real `~/.claude` file.

Run from anywhere; imports from `schoen-claude-status` by path.
