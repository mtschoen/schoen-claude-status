## Quality gate: aislop

This project uses **aislop** as a deterministic quality gate for AI-written code
(narrative comments, swallowed exceptions, `as any`, dead stubs, oversized
functions, etc.) across TS/JS, Python, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, Java, and C#.

`aislop` is installed globally on this machine (pinned to the fork
`mtschoen/aislop`, which adds C#/roslynator support). Call the installed binary
directly - do NOT use `npx aislop`, which pulls upstream from npm with no C#
support:

- **Before declaring work complete**, run `aislop scan .` and address findings.
- **Before committing**, run `aislop scan --staged` (staged files only).
- `aislop fix` auto-clears mechanical issues (formatting, unused imports, dead
  code); `aislop fix --claude` hands the rest back with full context.
- `aislop ci .` is the gate - exits non-zero if the score drops below the
  threshold in `.aislop/config.yml`. Treat a failing gate like a failing test.

To refresh the pinned binary after new commits land on the fork branch:
`pnpm add -g --allow-build=aislop "github:mtschoen/aislop#feat/csharp-support"`
