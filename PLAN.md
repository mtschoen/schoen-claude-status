# schoen-claude-status — Plan

## Inbox

- [ ] Fix red quality gate: ruff format drift + 2 aislop findings
      (hallucinated-import for repo-local `import install`, chained-dict-get)
      in scripts/verify_install_nudge_merge.py; `npm run lint:aislop` scores
      78 and exits non-zero. Introduced by 8b0ad4a.

## Done

- Optional native-walker integration (commit cc548d7): C++ (simdjson)
  was the bench winner at ~95ms cold, so detection was wired against
  the canonical `~/claude-walker/cpp/build/...` paths.
  `$CLAUDE_WALKER_BIN` override + PATH lookup. install.py prints which
  mode is active. Cache TTL also dropped 30s → 15s.
- Parallelize `_walk_pace_buckets` (commit 2b5e355): orjson + 8-worker
  ProcessPoolExecutor over per-session groups. 750ms → 248ms median,
  bit-exact match against the original. Cache TTL shortened 60s → 30s.
