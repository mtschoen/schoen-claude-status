═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Status:   PASS
Mode:     close-the-gap (lint gate stand-up)
Tests:    6 verify_*.py scripts — all passing
Git:      8a3f1b9 (earn strict zero — 0 rule ignores, all rules active)

Lint:     ruff 0 findings  ✓  (hard gate — `ruff check .` + `ruff format --check .`)
          pyright: not yet run to clean — CI step is non-blocking (`|| true`)
          shellcheck: not yet run to clean — CI step is non-blocking (`|| true`)
          0 rule-level ignores, 0 per-file-ignores — every finding the broad
            select surfaces is FIXED, not suppressed (incl. SIM105 -> contextlib
            .suppress, SIM115 -> context manager, RUF002/RUF003 -> ASCII 'x').
          1 per-case suppression: a single `# noqa: RUF001` in statusline_lib.py
            on the one user-facing '×' (the calibrated-ETA badge renders the
            multiplication sign literally; ASCII 'x' would change output).
            Justified inline at the site.

Coverage: NOT INSTRUMENTED — no coverage.py / line-coverage tooling is
          configured in this repo. The 6 scripts/verify_*.py are behavioral
          verification scripts (exercised in CI), not a coverage-measured
          suite. Standing up line coverage is out of scope for the lint
          rollout and is flagged as candidate future work.

On-save:      .claude/settings.json PostToolUse hook (ruff -q per edited .py)
CI:           .gitea/workflows/ci.yml  (lint job — ruff hard, pyright/shell soft)
