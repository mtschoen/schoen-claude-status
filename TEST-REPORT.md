═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Status:   PASS
Mode:     close-the-gap (lint + AI-slop gate stand-up)
Tests:    6 verify_*.py scripts — all passing
Git:      6603409 (aislop wired as a hard CI gate)

Lint:     ruff          0 findings  ✓  (hard gate: `ruff check .` + `ruff format --check .`)
          aislop        100 / 100   ✓  (hard gate: `npx aislop@0.9.4 ci .`, failBelow 90)
          pyright       non-blocking in CI (`|| true`) — not yet run to clean
          shellcheck    non-blocking in CI (`|| true`) — not yet run to clean

          ruff: 0 rule-level ignores, 0 per-file-ignores — every finding is
            FIXED, not suppressed. 1 per-case `# noqa: RUF001` on the one
            user-facing '×' (the calibrated-ETA badge; ASCII would change output).
          aislop: reached 100 by FIXING, not suppressing —
            - undeclared imports: orjson/psutil declared in requirements.txt;
              statusline_lib FPs resolved by making it a package directory.
            - swallowed exceptions: each best-effort `except: pass` carries a
              specific failure-mode comment; print() -> logging.warning.
            - narrative comments: cosmetic dividers + flagged prose removed
              (load-bearing rationale moved into helpers/docstrings/git history).
            - complexity: long/deeply-nested functions extracted into helpers;
              the 1376-line statusline_lib.py split into a 7-module package
              (all < 400 lines).
            - config: no exclusions — the verify suite (scripts/**) is scanned
              and clean; .aislop/config.yml failBelow 90.
            - verify suite (scripts/**): bare-except restored to a guarded
              finally (no swallowed errors), 139-line check() split into four
              focused helpers, narrative comments folded into docstrings/removed.

Coverage: NOT INSTRUMENTED — no coverage.py / line-coverage tooling is
          configured. The 6 scripts/verify_*.py are behavioral verification
          scripts (run in CI), not a coverage-measured suite. Standing up line
          coverage is out of scope for the lint rollout; flagged as future work.
